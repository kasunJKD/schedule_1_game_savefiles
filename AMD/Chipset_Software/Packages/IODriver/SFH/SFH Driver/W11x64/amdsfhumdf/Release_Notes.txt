AMD Sensor Fusion Hub
---------------------
AMD Sensor Fusion Hub (will be referred as SFH device) is a PCI Express Endpoint and Sensor UMDF driver.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Important notes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) The driver (version 216) is not compatible with firmware’s prior to 1.0.23 firmware. Please UPDATE firmware/BIOS before using AMD SFH drivers 216 and above driver.
2) New dynamic discovery functionality has been added to the AMD SFH driver version 216 and above, so this functionality is not compatible/available with the older AMD SFH driver. If the different combination of driver’s version is used (example older KMDF driver and new UMDF driver and) or Rollbacking the KMDF or UMDF drivers may cause system BSOD. So please use the same version of the UMDF and KMDF drivers or there is need for the Rollback, please uninstall the both the drivers, and install the required drivers.
